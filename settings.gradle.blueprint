/* From  settings.gradle.blueprint the settings file of MIB ITSELF is created.
   So YOUR CUSTOM CODE for that settings file should go INTO THIS BLUEPRINT.
   
   Process is the following:
   1) Current existing settings.gradle is overwritten with the blueprint
   2) A scan for the directory you specified for your microservices in the build script is made
   2.1) For every project in that microservices folder, an entry in this settings.gradle file is generated.
